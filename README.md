Extra credit problems for the MVC section of the .NET bootcamp

## Exercise 1: MVCMovie App

Let's add additional functionality to the MVC Movie app you did as your first MVC tutorial.

* Change the rating input from a text input where the user can input anything they want to a dropdown. Link the dropdown to a enum you define in the Movie class file. You'll need to change your code in every view where the rating can be set or displayed.
* Modify the Movie view index file to display the database information in a "prettier" format. Use your imagination. Anything is acceptable as long as you think it looks better than the simple rows the tutorial creates. You should still be able to access all the CRUD functions the current design allows in your new design.

## Exercise 2: Address Book x2

* Redo the address book you did as a console app as a MVC application. You will need to start a new project, but depending on how you wrote the original code, you might be able to reuse some of your work.
* Try to do this project without looking at the insturctions for the Movie app. This project can essentially be done by mimicking the Movie app project. Because no new skills outside of what was already taught are needed, you'll learn more by doing as much as possible from memory.
* Implement your search function using LINQ syntax.
* Add appropriate validation and/or attributes to your model
